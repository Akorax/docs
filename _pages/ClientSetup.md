# Client setup
First, download the client version you want to use. (See [links](_pages/Links))

## Vanilla (1.12 to 3.3.5)

- Edit the contents realmlist.wtf to match the server external IP (or web-address if on)

From our example in ([Remote setup](_pages/Setup3)) the following would apply:

- `set realmlist 192.168.10.6` would be used for a client on the local network.
- `set realmlist 17.53.172.224` would be used for a client on the remote network.

## Classic (1.14)

Using the classic client on a non-classic server requires a data translation tool called HermesProxy (See [links](_pages/Links)).
Installation of this tool isn't all that difficult but until I can write up a good instruction I recommend following the instructions on the download page and asking for help in the SPP discord server if required. In my opinion playing on the classic client is a better experience than vanilla.
