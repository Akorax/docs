# Client setup

## Vanilla (1.12 to 3.3.5)

- Download the correct client version from a website (See [links](_pages/Links))
- Edit the contents realmlist.wtf to match the server external IP (or web-address if on)

From our example in ([Remote setup](_pages/Setup3)) the following would apply:

- `set realmlist 192.168.10.6` would be used for a client on the local network.
- `set realmlist 17.53.172.224` would be used for a client on the remote network.

## Classic (1.14)

Download, config and go. Something hermes text.
