# Comments
Comments can be typed directly into the script. They are preceded by the `#` symbol. You can also use this to disable certain script lines. Any extra blank spaces between comments and code will be trimmed off when saving the script.

	#This comments out the entire line, which is then ignored by the game.
 
	init::disable:lights;      #This comment does NOT block the event on the same line.
