# Scripting

Scripting is programmed level-specific behaviour that is currently defined by inputting command lines in the level files' ****script**** section. It has three main components:
* Variables
* Triggers
* Events

Variables are used to keep track of what's happening in the level. Triggers check for when something specific occurs in the level. Events are executed to alter the level or player in some way.

To assist you with scripting the Level Editor can display the Row, Column and Tile ID of the tile beneath the mouse cursor. This function is activated when you press the Script Interface button in the Level Editor.

There is also a handy log that tells you exactly what has occured and if any errors happen.
If you are going to use class references in your scripting, head over to the scripting classes page.
